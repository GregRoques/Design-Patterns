# Composite Pattern

- used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.

- Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.

- This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects: these can be independent (leaf) or other composite objects. The parent class provides ways to modify its group of similar objects; methods used on one object should be applicable to all other objects.
