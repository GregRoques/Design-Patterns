# Facade Pattern

A facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.

**Benefits:**

- makes it easy to change code in the future, reduces errors by reducing redundancy.
- improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single API
