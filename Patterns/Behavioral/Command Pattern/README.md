# Command Pattern

- a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates actions into particular commands, and allows you to invoke and undo them.

-The central ideas of this design pattern closely mirror the semantics of first-class functions (take functions as argument) and higher-order functions (take functions as argument or return function) in functional programming languages . Specifically, the **invoker object** is a higher-order function of which the command object is a first-class argument.
