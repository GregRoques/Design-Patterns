# Observer Pattern

**_Observer pattern_** is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically.

- Typically, an object, named the _subject_, maintains a list of its dependents, called _observers_, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
